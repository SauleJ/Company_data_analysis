## Data Analysis and Visualization Repository

This repository contains R code for data analysis and visualization of the provided dataset "Future-500-2.csv". The dataset includes information about various companies such as their name, industry, inception year, number of employees, revenue, expenses, profit, and growth.

### How it Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The code first loads the dataset using the `read.csv()` function from the `readr` package. It then preprocesses the data by converting certain columns to numeric format, removing unnecessary symbols, handling missing values, and correcting errors.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The code performs exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset. This includes generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions using histograms, detecting outliers using box plots, and exploring correlations between variables.

3. **Data Visualization**: Various visualization techniques are employed to illustrate insights from the data. This includes bar plots, violin plots, scatter plots, and waffle charts to visualize company attributes such as revenue, profit, expenses, growth, and industry distribution.

4. **Normalization**: The code normalizes the data using both min-max normalization and mean/variance normalization techniques.

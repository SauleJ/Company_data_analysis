## Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains R code for analyzing financial data from the Future-500 dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration of various financial metrics.

## Data

The financial data used in this analysis is stored in the `Future-500-2.csv` file. It includes information about various companies, such as their inception year, number of employees, revenue, expenses, profit, growth, industry, and state.

### Code Explanation

The R script performs the following tasks:

1. **Loading and Cleaning Data**: Reads the dataset, examines its structure, and performs data cleaning tasks such as removing unnecessary symbols and handling missing values.
2. **Initial Data Analysis**: Calculates the variance of different variables in the dataset.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Imputes missing values with appropriate replacements.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and removes outliers from the dataset.
5. **Dispersion Analysis**: Analyzes dispersion of variables by industry sector.
6. **Top and Bottom Values**: Identifies top and bottom companies based on profit and revenue.
7. **Summary by Industry**: Generates summary statistics for each industry sector.
8. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculates correlation coefficients between different variables.
9. **Normalization**: Normalizes data using different methods.
10. **Visualization**: Creates various visualizations including histograms, bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, and waffle plots.
